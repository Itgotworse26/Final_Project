Final Group Assignment for Module 20

## Machine Learning (Triangle Role)
The model I hope to use is the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier. In a previous project to classify whether a credit loan application was high-risk or low-risk, a classifier that used the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier achieved a balanced accuracy score of about 93.17%. I hope that the further use of this model leads to a similar accuracy on our current project.

To quote the scikit description of the EEAC:

"An AdaBoost classifier is a meta-estimator that begins by fitting a classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases."
