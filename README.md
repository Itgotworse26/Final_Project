Final Group Assignment for Module 20

## Machine Learning (Triangle Role)
The model I hope to use is the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier. In a previous project to classify whether a credit loan application was high-risk or low-risk, a classifier that used the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier achieved a balanced accuracy score of about 93.17%. I hope that the further use of this model leads to a similar accuracy on our current project.
